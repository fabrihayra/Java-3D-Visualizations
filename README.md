# Project Overview:
These three Java projects were developed using the Processor application on a MacBook. The projects are designed to showcase different aspects of Java programming, including graphics and 3D rendering.

* Terrain Generation
The Terrain Generation project is a program that generates a 3D terrain using Perlin noise. It allows users to adjust the terrain's parameters and view the terrain from different angles. The program was built using the Processing graphics library and utilizes Perlin noise functions to generate the terrain.

* Point Cloud 3D (Mandelbulb 3D Fractal)
The Point Cloud 3D project is a program that generates a 3D Mandelbulb fractal using point cloud rendering techniques. It allows users to adjust the fractal's parameters and view it from different angles. The program was built using the Processing graphics library and utilizes point cloud rendering techniques to generate the fractal.

* 3D Cube
The 3D Cube project is a program that renders a 3D cube and allows users to rotate and zoom in on the cube. The program was built using the Processing graphics library and utilizes 3D rendering techniques to generate the cube.

## Installation:
To run these projects, you will need to have Java and Processing installed on your machine. You can download Processing from the Processing website: https://processing.org/download/

## Usage:
To run any of these projects, open the project folder in Processing and run the main Java file. Use the on-screen controls to adjust the parameters and view the program's output.
